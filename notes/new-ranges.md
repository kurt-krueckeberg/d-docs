# Ranges in D

## The Concept of Ranges

* [On Iterators](on_iterators.md)&mdash;Andrei Alexandrecu's article that describes the creation of D's std.ranges and how ranges improve on STL-compliant iterators.
* [Iterators Must Go](https://www.accu.org/conf-docs/PDFs_2009/AndreiAlexandrescu_iterators-must-go.pdf) slides to a talk by Andrei Alexandrescu
* [Iterators and Ranges: Comparing C++ to D to Rust - Barry Revzin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qY4dZ2r4w)&mdash; is a thorough talk on iterators and ranges.
