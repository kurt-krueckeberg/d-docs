# Ranges in D

## Ranges Introduction

* [On Iterators](on_iterators.md)&mdash;Andrei Alexandrecu's article explaining how he came to invent D's ranges during the implementation of D's generic algorithms and containers.
* [Iterators Must Go](https://www.accu.org/conf-docs/PDFs_2009/AndreiAlexandrescu_iterators-must-go.pdf) are the slides to a talk on ranges by Andrei Alexandrescu
* [Iterators and Ranges: Comparing C++ to D to Rust - Barry Revzin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qY4dZ2r4w)&mdash; is a thorough video lecture on iterators and ranges in general.
