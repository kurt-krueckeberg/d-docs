# Ranges in D

## Ranges Introduction

* [Iterators Must Go](https://www.accu.org/conf-docs/PDFs_2009/AndreiAlexandrescu_iterators-must-go.pdf) are the slides to a talk on ranges by Andrei Alexandrescu
* [On Iterators](on_iterators.md)&mdash;Andrei Alexandrecu's article explaining how he came to invent D's ranges during the implementation of D's generic algorithms and containers.
* [D Programming-Ranges](https://adglob.in/blog/d-programming-ranges/)&lmark;Introduction to the basic range interfaces.
* [Ranges](http://ddili.org/ders/d.en/ranges.html) and the its next page [More on Ranges](http://ddili.org/ders/d.en/ranges_more.html) are from the **Programming in D** online book.
* [Ranges tour](https://tour.dlang.org/tour/en/basics/ranges) explains how `foreach` uses ranges and the semantics of ranges.
